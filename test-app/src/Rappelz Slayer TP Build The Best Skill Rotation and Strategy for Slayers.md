## What are Talent Points?
 
Talent points are a special currency that you can use to enhance your skills as a Master Class. You can earn TP by completing Master Trials and quests from Hero Hector. You can also buy TP with real money or trade them with other players. You can spend TP on various skill enhancements, such as increasing damage, reducing cooldowns, adding effects, and more. You can also use TP to unlock new skills that are exclusive to your Master Class.

As a Slayer, you have access to a variety of skills that can help you deal massive damage, evade attacks, stealth, and more. However, not all skills are equally useful or worth spending TP on. Here are some of the best skills to invest your TP on as a Slayer:

You can use TP to increase the damage, stun duration, and critical rate of this skill. This is a must-have skill for any Slayer who wants to burst down enemies quickly.
- **Shadow Walk**: This skill allows you to enter stealth mode, making you invisible to enemies and increasing your movement speed.

This is a great skill for sneaking up on enemies, escaping danger, or repositioning yourself in combat.

## How to Choose Your Weapons?
 
As a Slayer, you have the option of using either dual swords or dual daggers as your main weapons. Both have their pros and cons, and the choice ultimately depends on your personal preference and budget. Here are some factors to consider when choosing your weapons:

- **Swords**: Swords have higher base damage and critical power than daggers, making them more effective for dealing burst damage. Swords also have more options for equipment sets that can enhance their performance, such as Phase Blades or Draka sets. However, swords are more expensive and require heavier armor to compensate for their lower health bonus.
- **Daggers**: Daggers have lower base damage and critical power than swords, but they have higher attack speed and health bonus, making them more suitable for sustained damage and survivability. Daggers also have cheaper equipment sets that can boost their health and defense, such as Shadow Forged Plating or Lilith sets. However, daggers have fewer options for equipment sets that can improve their damage output.

## How to Optimize Your Equipment?
 
Besides your weapons, you also need to pay attention to your other equipment pieces, such as armor, gloves, boots, belt pets, soul stones, boss cards, etc. These items can provide various bonuses that can improve your stats and performance as a Slayer. Here are some tips on how to optimize your equipment:
