The game is available on Steam[^1^], but if you want to download it for free, you might be interested in the FitGirl Repack version. FitGirl Repacks is a website that distributes pirated games in compressed sizes, saving you bandwidth and storage space. FitGirl Repacks claims to be the only official site for their repacks, and warns you to avoid fake and scam sites that use their name[^5^]. However, downloading pirated games is illegal and risky, so do it at your own discretion.
 
If you are looking for a unique and atmospheric sci-fi game with elements of simulation, roguelike, action, combat, and horror, Scavenger SV-4 might be the game for you. But be careful, bad things sometimes happen to lone explorers far from home.

Scavenger SV-4 is not a typical sci-fi game. It has a realistic and immersive approach to the exploration of an alien world. You have to use your rover's camera, sensors, and tools to scan, analyze, and manipulate the environment. You also have to monitor your rover's battery, fuel, temperature, and integrity levels, as well as your own oxygen and radiation exposure. The game does not hold your hand or give you clear objectives. You have to figure out what to do and where to go by yourself.
 
The game also has a roguelike element, meaning that every time you die or start a new game, the planet is randomly generated with different terrain, weather, flora, fauna, and anomalies. You also get a different backstory and personality for your character, which affects how you interact with the rover and the planet. The game has a lot of replay value and variety, as you never know what you will find or encounter on each run.
 
Another aspect of the game that sets it apart from other sci-fi games is the horror element. The game creates a sense of isolation and dread as you explore the desolate and dangerous planet. You will encounter strange and hostile creatures, mysterious structures, and unsettling events that will test your sanity and courage. The game also has a dynamic soundtrack that adapts to the situation and mood of the game. The game is not for the faint of heart, as it can be quite scary and stressful at times.

Scavenger SV-4 is a game that will appeal to fans of sci-fi, simulation, roguelike, and horror genres. It is a game that offers a lot of challenge, immersion, and discovery. It is also a game that is constantly being updated and improved by the developer, who listens to the feedback and suggestions of the players. The game has a very positive rating on Steam, with many players praising its originality, atmosphere, and gameplay.
