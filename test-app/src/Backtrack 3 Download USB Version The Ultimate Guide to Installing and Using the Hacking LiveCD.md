BackTrack 3 is a Linux distribution designed for penetration testing and security auditing. It contains a collection of tools and utilities for hacking, cracking, and exploiting various systems and networks. BackTrack 3 is no longer supported by its developers, who have moved on to create Kali Linux, a more advanced and updated version of BackTrack. However, some users may still prefer to use BackTrack 3 for various reasons, such as compatibility, nostalgia, or curiosity.

One of the advantages of BackTrack 3 is that it can be run from a USB drive, without installing it on the hard disk of the computer. This allows users to boot into BackTrack 3 on any machine that supports USB booting, and use it as a portable hacking toolkit. Running BackTrack 3 from a USB drive also preserves the original operating system and files of the computer, as BackTrack 3 does not make any changes to the hard disk.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download and install BackTrack 3 on a USB drive, using a Windows computer as an example. You will need a USB drive with at least 2 GB of free space, and a computer that can boot from USB.
 
## Step 1: Download BackTrack 3 ISO file
 
The first step is to download the ISO file of BackTrack 3 from the official website: https://www.backtrack-linux.org/. You can choose between two versions: BT3 CD version (695 MB) or BT3 USB version (784 MB). The CD version is designed to be burned on a CD and booted from it, while the USB version is designed to be copied on a USB drive and booted from it. For this tutorial, we will use the USB version.
 
Once you have downloaded the ISO file, you will need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should see a folder called BT3 with several files and subfolders inside it.
 
## Step 2: Format the USB drive
 
The next step is to format the USB drive using the FAT32 file system. This will erase all the data on the USB drive, so make sure you back up any important files before proceeding. To format the USB drive, follow these steps:
 
- Insert the USB drive into your computer and open My Computer or This PC.
- Right-click on the USB drive and select Format.
- Select FAT32 as the file system and check the Quick Format option.
- Click Start and wait for the format to complete.

## Step 3: Copy BackTrack 3 files to the USB drive
 
The final step is to copy the files from the BT3 folder that you extracted earlier to the root directory of the USB drive. You can use Windows Explorer or any other file manager to do this. You should copy all the files and subfolders inside the BT3 folder, except for the ISO file itself. The ISO file is not needed for booting from USB, and it will take up unnecessary space on your USB drive.
 
Once you have copied all the files, you can safely eject the USB drive from your computer. You have successfully created a bootable BackTrack 3 USB drive.
